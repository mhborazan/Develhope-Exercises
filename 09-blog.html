      <p>According to a study conducted by Washington University in St. Louis1, students who use laptops during class sessions tend to have lower grades than those who do not use them. However, this study also found that students who use laptops for note-taking tend to perform better than those who do not use them at all.</p>

      <p>Another study conducted by the University of Michigan2 found that students who use laptops for note-taking tend to remember more information than those who take notes by hand. This is because laptops allow students to type faster than they can write by hand.</p>
      <p>Laptops are also used for entertainment purposes such as playing games and surfing the internet. A study conducted by ScienceDirect3 found that students who use laptops for non-academic purposes during class sessions tend to have lower grades than those who do not use them at all.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, laptops can be used for various purposes such as work, entertainment, and education. However, their usage during class sessions can have a negative impact on academic performance if not used correctly. Students should use laptops for note-taking purposes only and avoid using them for non-academic purposes during class sessions.</p>
